# coldCounter

coldCounter is an open source data infrastructure project designed to aggregate, normalize, and document publicly available information related to immigration enforcement outcomes in the United States.

The system was created on March 4, 2026 by No Concentration Camps in Colorado to support legal researchers, journalists, policy analysts, and civil rights organizations seeking transparent and reproducible data on immigration enforcement practices.

coldCounter provides a portable SQLite data mart built, refreshed, and shared at the researcher's will.

# Purpose

Immigration enforcement data in the United States is distributed across multiple federal agencies and public publications. These sources often differ in formatting, classification systems, and accessibility.

coldCounter was developed to:

- Aggregate immigration enforcement data derived from publicly available government sources  
- Normalize offense classification codes used in enforcement systems  
- Provide a transparent and reproducible database structure  
- Enable legal researchers to evaluate enforcement classifications  
- Support litigation, policy analysis, and investigative journalism  

The project emphasizes **traceability, reproducibility, and documentation** so that independent researchers can understand how enforcement classifications are represented within the database.

---

# System Overview

coldCounter consists of two primary functional layers:

1. Database Construction  
2. Analytical Reporting

---

# Database Construction

The database is built using Python scripts that generate and populate a SQLite data mart.

SQLite was selected because it allows the entire dataset to be distributed as a **portable single-file database**, which can easily be shared among researchers, opened in database tools, or attached to analytical workflows.

The construction scripts perform tasks including:

- Creating the database schema  
- Importing immigration enforcement data  
- Normalizing classification systems  
- Populating dimensional reference tables  

---

# Analytical Reporting

The project includes scripts used to generate aggregated reports from the database.

These scripts allow users to produce summary outputs useful for:

- Legal analysis  
- Policy research  
- Investigative reporting  
- Statistical summaries of enforcement data

# Building the Database

The coldCounter database can be built locally using the provided setup scripts.

## Step 1 — Run the primary ETL process
The coldCounter.db file available for download in the repository is preloaded with all current data available as of the last repository update.
**YOU MAY SKIP THIS STEP UNLESS YOU WANT TO GENERATE A NEW coldCounter.db FILE**

Run the install_or_refresh_coldCounter.bat file

This script performs the primary **Extract-Transform-Load (ETL)** process that constructs the base database and imports current data sets.

---

## Step 2 — Browse the Data Mart

The build script will create coldCounter.db

Open the Beekeeper Portable Data Browser folder and run Beekeeper-Studio-5.6.0-portable.exe

If prompted: 
    - Connection type = SQLite
    - Database File - *Choose your coldCounter.db file*

Save connection for easier future access. 

```
python setup/dim_ncic_offense_codes.py
```

This script populates the dimensional table containing **NCIC offense code references** which are used to standardize offense classifications within the database.

After both scripts have been executed successfully the **coldCounter SQLite database will be fully constructed and ready for analysis.**

# Data Sources

coldCounter relies exclusively on publicly available government and institutional publications related to immigration enforcement and criminal offense classification.

Reference materials incorporated into the database include publications and documentation from:

- U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)  
- U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS)  
- Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)  
- United States Sentencing Commission (USSC)  
- U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ)  

The project may also incorporate datasets and documents derived from these institutional publications that have been obtained through Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) litigation conducted by legal organizations, researchers, and civil rights advocates.

These materials are used to construct normalized classification references and supporting analytical datasets within the database.

---

# Data Provenance and Methodology

coldCounter is designed to ensure that all database content is traceable to publicly available source materials. The project does **not rely on proprietary datasets or unpublished government records.**

---

# Source Material

All reference data incorporated into the database originates from publicly published materials issued by United States government agencies and related institutions.

These materials provide the **legal and administrative definitions** used to construct dimensional reference tables within the database.

---

# Data Transformation Process

coldCounter is built through a **reproducible Extract-Transform-Load workflow implemented in Python.**

The construction process follows three stages.

## Extraction

Publicly available datasets and classification references are collected from government publications and documentation.

## Transformation

Extracted data is normalized into consistent formats suitable for database storage. This process includes:

- Standardizing classification codes  
- Structuring reference data into dim and fact tables  

## Loading

The normalized data is loaded into a SQLite data mart designed for analytical queries and reporting.

The ETL process is executed through the repository setup scripts allowing the database to be rebuilt deterministically by independent researchers.

---

# Reproducibility

Because the database is generated through scripted processes users can independently reconstruct the dataset by executing the provided setup script.

This reproducibility allows researchers to verify:

- Database schema design  
- Data transformation methods  
- Classification mappings  

The goal is to ensure that the coldCounter database functions as a **transparent analytical tool rather than a closed dataset.**

---

# Scope and Limitations

coldCounter aggregates and normalizes publicly available reference materials related to immigration enforcement classification systems.

The project does **not independently verify the accuracy of the underlying government publications** from which reference data is derived.

coldCounter is intended to document classification structures and provide analytical infrastructure for examining ICE data.

The database should **not be interpreted as an authoritative statement of federal enforcement policy or as a comprehensive record of immigration enforcement activity.**

Users of the database should consult original government publications when making legal or policy determinations.

---

# Intended Use

coldCounter is designed to support:

- Legal research  
- Policy analysis  
- Investigative journalism  
- Academic research  
- Civil rights monitoring  

The system provides a structured representation of immigration enforcement classifications that can be examined independently by researchers and legal professionals.
